# Project webpage

#### Instructions to edit the main page
- To edit the text, just modify the Index.md file, it takes Markdown text, but can also be used with HTML code (e.g <center></center> ...)
- If you want to include a html graph, add it the the \_includes folder and add {% include Your_Graph.html %} to the Index.md
